# Cognifyz Java Projects Level 1
Unlocked Level 1! Just wrapped up all 4 tasks with a bow on my Java Development Internship at Cognifyz Technologies.

# Task 1 - Temperature Converter
It effortlessly converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. So, you're prompted to just pop in a temperature value and tell it whether it's in Celsius or Fahrenheit. And bam! It does the conversion trick and gives you the converted temperature.

# Task 2 - Palindrome Checker
Imagine having a program that can tell you whether a word or phrase is a palindrome. You know, a palindrome is something like "racecar" or "madam," which reads the same forwards and backwards. The cool part is, this program would ignore spaces and punctuation, so "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!" would also be recognized as a palindrome.

# Task 3 - Student Grade Calculator 
It's pretty handy for calculating and showing the average grade of a student. It prompts you to enter how many grades you want to calculate the average for. Once you've entered that, you can input each of the grades. The program then does its magic and calculates the average for you.

# Task 4 - Random Password Generator 
I've got a nifty program that can whip up a random password just for you. All you need to do is let me know how long you want your password to be and what ingredients you'd like to include. Do you want numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and maybe even some special characters in the mix? Just give me the details, and I'll handle the rest. Once I have all the info, I'll generate the perfect password according to your preferences and present it to you on a silver platter, or well, on your screen! So, let's create that super secure and unique password together!
